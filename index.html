  <!--<h2>About</h2>-->
  <p>At Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation, we know you want to be pain-free and functioning your best. The problem is: YOUR PAIN IS CHANGING YOU. Maybe you cannot sit through a work day without constantly thinking about your pain. Or perhaps you are losing sleep due to pain, and that’s impacting your work, your studies, or your hobbies. Or maybe you find yourself being irritable with loved ones due to your ailment.

<p>Behind every case of pain is a HUMAN STORY. We understand that no one is at their “best” when they hurt. That’s why we make it our mission to eliminate unnecessary pain and suffering in the State College and Centre County area via chiropractic office visits. Our broader reach through telehealth is part of our mission to help change more lives and positively impact more communities in Pennsylvania.

<p>We place a heavy premium on rehabilitation exercises, especially McKenzie Method physical therapy. We believe that people obtain their greatest outcomes with chiropractic care when provided with self-empowerment and home management strategies; it takes teamwork. We also stress the importance of more contact time with patients, so we provide 20-25 minute follow-up sessions to correctly identify the sources of pain and reduce them.

<p>Even changing one person’s life in a positive way is crucial, because each of us are connected with so many others in our communities. When you reduce your pain, you enhance your function, your potential and productivity, and your happiness and fulfillment. And that in turn improves your family and home, your workplace, and your community.

<p>So, don’t let your pain change you; let’s work together SO YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR PAIN! Your journey to wellness starts here at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation: Live At Your Peak, so We Can Build Healthier Communities Together!<p>

<p><h3>Testimonials</h3>
<p>Dr. Emery is fantastic. My mother-in-law recommended him to me, and now I see why. He is a great communicator, listening carefully to how I am doing, and carefully explaining his responses. He is sensitive to my comfort level, never doing adjustments without explaining them first and asking for consent. He recommends a repertoire of stretches and strengthening exercises between each appointment, so I'm not relying on the adjustments alone.
<br> <b>-Manuel</b>

<p>Dr. Emery Pitcel is very communicative, knowledgable and compassionate. Throughout our professional relationship, he has helped to realign my neck and restore my overall range of movement. I would recommend his services to anyone in the area (or beyond!) dealing with neck and back pain.
<br> <b>-Fe Lorraine</b>

<p>Dr. Emery is a very friendly guy that genuinely wants to see you get better and improve. He does the adjustments needed in office, but also sends you home with stretches and exercises to allow you to feel relief at home. I'd definitely recommend him to anyone.
<br> <b>-Kayla</b>
