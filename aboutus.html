	<h5>Inspired by Chiropractic Care</h5>

<p>When Dr. Emery was 8 years old, he suffered his first asthma attack. After suffering from asthma for a few months, one chiropractor suggested he eliminate dairy and limit wheat to manage his childhood asthma. This made a profound difference in his health, opening up the door for him to compete in cross-county and track & field in high school and collegiately. Chiropractors were integral in keeping him healthy as an athlete, and this inspired him to pursue chiropractic school.</p>


	<h5>Becoming a Chiropractor</h5>
<p>Dr. Emery realized that helping people get out of physical pain, improve their daily activities and function, and perform their best physically or athletically was his true passion. He saw time and again how pain could alter someone’s life for the negative, and he was driven to help people gain their physical health back through natural means..</p>


<p>Dr. Emery attended Grand Valley State University for his undergraduate studies, where he obtained a B.S. in Biomedical Sciences/Pre-Med in December 2013. He received his Doctor of Chiropractic degree (DC) from National University of Health Sciences in Lombard, Illinois in April 2017.</p>


	<h5>Dr. Emery’s Additional Clinical Skill Sets</h5>
<p>While at NUHS, Dr. Emery developed a love for functional rehabilitation, and he added a certification in <a href="https://mckenzieinstitute.org/patients/" style="color:black">McKenzie Method of Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) </a>. This physical therapy system determines if an injured area has a directional preference, which is the repetitive movement exercise that needs to be performed to best decrease pain and increase functionality for that region. McKenzie Method is the premier rehabilitation system for acute and chronic disc injuries. He completes this assessment with nearly all his patients.</p>

His wife, <a href="https://www.me.psu.edu/department/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=kzf5356" style="color:black">Dr. Katie Fitzsimons</a>, accepted a position as an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Penn State University in April 2020. Dr. Emery and his family moved to State College in December 2020. He is eager and excited to serve the Centre County region for years to come. </p>


	<h5>Outside the Practice</h5>
<p>Dr. Emery has a two young daughters named Aubrey and Reese and a fur baby, Curie (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/curieawwsity/" class="fa fa-instagram"></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/curieawwsity/"> @curieawwsity</a>). His hobbies include running, hiking around Nittany Valley, biking, traveling, and watching all kinds of sports. He always strives to give back to the community by participating in programs like toys for tots, local food drives, and other philanthropic activities. He still considers himself "new to the area," so he'd also love to hear about other unique ways he can get involved in the Centre county community.  </p>
