title: CONDITION OF THE MONTH - RIB OUT OF PLACE
date: 2024-08-02
---

We are continuing our monthly series called “Condition of the Month.” Each month, we’ll give a quick bio of an injury we frequently diagnose and treat at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation. These conditions range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities. We wish to educate the public on these injuries, and how we can help as chiropractors.

This month, we are highlighting **rib out of place.**

**-What is it?** The back part of each of the 12 ribs (bilaterally) attaches to the thoracic spine. If this joint is out of alignment by even millimeters, the result can be extreme pain.

**-What are some symptoms?** Patients report difficulty drawing in a deep breath due to stabbing pain. Bending, slouching, and putting on clothes can all be very challenging.

**-What causes it?** This injury can happen due to aggressive coughing or sneezing, bending/twisting incorrectly, or a fall/trauma. Poor posture plays a factor in slipping ribs, too.

**-How to fix it?** We focus on rehab exercises FIRST to address the pain and loss of function. Then, muscle therapy and chiropractic adjustments are applied to further decrease pain, increase function, and reduce the muscle issues.

**-How long will it take to heal?** It depends, but most rib out-of-place cases are resolved within 3-6 office visits over 2-5 weeks.
