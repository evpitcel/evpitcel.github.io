We are continuing our monthly series called “Top Five OR Five Common Physical Medicine Facts.” Each month, we’ll give a top 5 list, ranging from reasons for injuries to conditions themselves to misconceptions about healthcare to ways to help small offices/businesses, and so on. All these problems range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities.

This month, Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation presents **The Top Five benefits of chiropractic according to a Cleveland Clinic article.**

We have heard and read in many places that chiropractic adjustments are safe and effective. BUT most of the reference material online is written by other chiropractors.

That’s why we think it’s a BIG DEAL that the Cleveland Clinic has a highly detailed article dedicated to chiropractic adjustments and care. A highly reputable medical establishment detailing chiropractic care is noteworthy. Here are the 5 benefits they highlighted in their piece (full article here: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21033-chiropractic-adjustment).

1. Minimize headaches, migraines
2. Improve posture
3. Increase ROM, lower pain in spine and other joints
4. Decrease chronic symptoms, such as osteoarthritis
5. Treat minor spine trauma, including whiplash

**Reach out to us at Rothrock Chiro and Rehab to learn more about each of these benefits. Watch out on Facebook and YouTube for our video on this topic!**
