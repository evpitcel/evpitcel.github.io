We are solidly into May in Happy Valley and Central Pennsylvania! While it’s amazing to usher in spring, the abuse our flower beds and gardens took over the long winter need to be addressed. But often our bodies aren’t conditioned to handle the stress of gardening and yard work, which can jeopardize our own physical and musculoskeletal health.

Given that, here are 5 tips on gardening to reduce back pain, along with how chiropractic care can help!

1. **Use Proper Body Mechanics.** Make sure to bend at the knees and lift with your legs, especially when picking up heavy objects like bags of soil or plants. Please avoid twisting your spine while lifting, as this places major strain on your back muscles.
2. **Take Breaks and Pace Yourself.** It’s wise to alternate between different gardening tasks and take regular breaks to rest your back. If you’ve learned stretches from us, use them during your breaks! Overexertion can lead to muscle fatigue and increase the risk of injury.
3. **Invest in Ergonomic Tools.** Use gardening tools with ergonomic designs that reduce strain on your back, hands, and other joints. Great examples of this are long-handled tools that can help minimize bending and reaching. We also advise using padded kneelers or knee pads that can provide support during ground-level tasks.
4. **Maintain Good Posture.** Keep your back straight and shoulders relaxed while gardening. Avoid hunching over or arching your back excessively; this can strain your spine and lead to discomfort. If you aren’t sure how to correct your posture, then schedule to see us at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation!
5. **Get Your Chiropractic Adjustment!** Schedule with us proactively for treatment if you know you’re about to work long hours in the garden beds. If you experience back pain or stiffness after gardening, then don’t hesitate to call us. Chiropractic adjustments can help restore spinal alignment and function, alleviate muscle tension, and improve overall mobility. All of this will make it easier to enjoy gardening activities without discomfort or injury.

We want you to feel and look like the best version of you, just like your gardens and yards. So invest in your own physical health with these five tips. Happy Spring, Happy Valley!
