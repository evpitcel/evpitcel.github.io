We are continuing our monthly series called “Top Five OR Five Common Physical Medicine Facts.” Each month, we’ll give a top 5 list, ranging from reasons for injuries to conditions themselves to misconceptions about healthcare to ways to help small offices/businesses, and so on. All these problems range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities.

This month, Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation presents **The Top Five Myths About Chiropractors.**

Chiropractic is the largest of the complementary, alternative medicine disciplines (CAM). Since it was traditionally viewed as alternative treatment for so many decades, there have been many myths and misconceptions formed about the profession.

Chiropractors are more accepted in the medical mainstream now than ever before, but some troubling myths continue to fester. They are that chiropractors are:

1. Mistrusted by Doctors
2. Dangerous with Adjustments
3. Less Educated than Doctors
4. Only Able to Treat Back Pain
5. Only Able to Treat Adults

**Reach out to us at Rothrock Chiro and Rehab to learn more about each of these myths. Watch out on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube for our video on this topic!**
