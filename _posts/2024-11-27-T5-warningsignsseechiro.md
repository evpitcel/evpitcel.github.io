title: TOP 5 WARNING SIGNS YOU NEED TO SEE A CHIROPRACTOR
date: 2024-11-27

We are continuing our monthly series called “Top Five OR Five Common Physical Medicine Facts.” Each month, we’ll give a top 5 list, ranging from reasons for injuries to conditions themselves to misconceptions about healthcare to ways to help small offices/businesses, and so on. All these problems range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities.

This month, Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation presents **The Top Five Warning Signs It's Time to See the Chiropractor.**

We all try our best to keep a finger on the pulse of our overall health. We try to listen to warning signs and go to the doctor as needed. We go to our family physician when we feel we have the flu. Or we go to the emergency room if there’s chest or abdominal pain we cannot explain.

But what are the obvious “warning signs” that suggest it’s time to see a chiropractor? We compiled a list of five signs that it’s time for an adjustment and/or exercise plan tweaking. Here’s our list:

1. Persistent low back pain
2. Frequent migraines, headaches
3. Lost mobility, range of motion
4. Numbness/tingling in the hands and/or feet
5. Uneven wearing in the bottom of the shoes

**Reach out to us at Rothrock Chiro and Rehab to learn more about each of these warning signs. Watch out on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube for our video on this topic!**
