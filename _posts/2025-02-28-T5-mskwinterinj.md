We are continuing our monthly series called “Top Five OR Five Common Physical Medicine Facts.” Each month, we’ll give a top 5 list, ranging from reasons for injuries to conditions themselves to misconceptions about healthcare to ways to help small offices/businesses, and so on. All these problems range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities.

This month, Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation presents **Top five musculoskeletal winter injuries.**

It’s February! Which means the toughest month of winter is behind us (January). However, there is still a good 4+ weeks remaining of this challenging season yet (you’ve got this!).

As a precautionary to keep everyone vigilant, we wanted to discuss the top five musculoskeletal injuries that take place during winter months, according to a European Orthopaedic Journal. These injuries mostly occur due to falls on ice, shoveling snow, and winter sports. Be more educated, so you can stay safe!

1. Knee Ligament Injuries, esp ACL and MCL
2. Rotator Cuff Tears
3. Lower Leg Fractures
4. Wrist Sprains
5. Low Back Strains, Lumbar Disc Injuries

**Reach out to us at Rothrock Chiro and Rehab to learn more about each of these injuries and how we may be able to help. Listen to <a href="https://youtu.be/USjnEEMPUdU">THE FULL PODCAST</a> on this topic right now!**
