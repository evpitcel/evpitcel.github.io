We are continuing our monthly series called “Top Five OR Five Common Physical Medicine Facts.” Each month, we’ll give a top 5 list, ranging from reasons for injuries to conditions themselves to misconceptions about healthcare to ways to help small offices/businesses, and so on. All these problems range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities.

This month, Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation presents **Top five chiropractic management tools for pregnancy.**

Pregnancy is an exciting time for a family. Soon, mom, dad, and the whole family will be welcoming a new life into the world! But, this is also a time where women may feel a loss of autonomy over their own bodies. They may grow fearful of a difficult labor or low back pain associated with being pregnant.

That’s why we utilize Webster technique to manage low back pain. These techniques may also lower the chances of having a difficult labor. Here are the top five areas we treat to support pregnancy:

1. Pelvic and sacral joints
2. Piriformis and hip flexor muscles
3. Sacrotuberous and round ligaments
4. Lumbar spine
5. Home exercises that are similar to midwife exercises

**Reach out to us at Rothrock Chiro and Rehab to learn more about the whole treatment protocol. Listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28dyHTn6Qzc">THE FULL PODCAST</a> on this topic right now!**
