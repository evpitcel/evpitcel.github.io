title: CONDITION OF THE MONTH - HIP IMPINGEMENT
date: 2024-11-08

We are continuing our monthly series called “Condition of the Month.” Each month, we’ll give a quick bio of an injury we frequently diagnose and treat at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation. These conditions range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities. We wish to educate the public on these injuries, and how we can help as chiropractors.

This month, we are highlighting **hip impingement.**

-**What is it?** The front portion of each hip contains ligaments, muscles, nerves, the labrum, and the joint itself. Any injury or irritation in that space can be diagnosed as hip impingement.

-**What are some symptoms?** Patients report stiffness with hip movements, difficulty going up stairs, pain getting into a squat, limping, hard time rising after sitting, or painful popping/clicking.

-**What causes it?** This injury can happen from working a desk job with too much sitting. Sports such as powerlifting and soccer can exasperate the tissues. Falling can create the injury, too.

-**How to fix it?** We focus on rehab exercises FIRST to address the pain and loss of function. Then, muscle therapy and chiropractic adjustments are applied to further decrease pain, increase function, and reduce the muscle issues.

-**How long will it take to heal?** It depends, but most hip impingement cases are resolved within 5-10 office visits over 6-12 weeks.
