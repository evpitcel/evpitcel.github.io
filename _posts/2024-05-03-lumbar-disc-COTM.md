title: CONDITION OF THE MONTH: LUMBAR DISC HERNIATION
date: 2024-05-03
---

We are starting a new monthly series called the “Condition of the Month.” Each month, we’ll give a quick bio of an injury we frequently diagnose and treat at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation. These conditions range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities. We wish to educate the public on these injuries, and how we can help as chiropractors.

For May 2024, we are highlighting **lumbar disc herniations.**

**-What is it?** The disc is a cartilage structure in the spine with a jelly center. When the wall weakens or gets injured, the disc center bulges the wall outward. This can create pain and loss of function.

**-Who gets it?** Men are 2x more likely than women to get this injury. Most happen between 35-50 years of age.

**-What causes it?** This injury can happen as a result of too much bending or twisting. Prolonged sitting and inactivity can cause the injury, too.

**-How to fix it?** We focus on rehab exercises FIRST to address the pain and loss of function. Then, muscle therapy and chiropractic adjustments are applied to further decrease pain, increase function, and reduce the muscle spasm.

**-How long will it take to heal?** It depends, but most disc herniations are resolved within 6-12 office visits over 4-12 weeks.
