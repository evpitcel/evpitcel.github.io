title: CONDITION OF THE MONTH - ROTATOR CUFF SYNDROME
date: 2025-02-27
----

We are continuing our monthly series called “Condition of the Month.” Each month, we’ll give a quick bio of an injury we frequently diagnose and treat at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation. These conditions range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities. We wish to educate the public on these injuries, and how we can help as chiropractors.

This month, we are highlighting **rotator cuff syndrome.**

-**What is it?** One of the four main rotator cuff muscles or tendons, typically the supraspinatus, gets injured, irritated, or partially torn, creating pain and loss of shoulder function.

-**What are some symptoms?** There will be pain or swelling near the shoulder. Overhead activities, throwing a ball, brushing hair, and/or reaching behind may all become painful or limited. 

-**What causes it?** Overuse injury is the most common, such as throwing sport athletes or too quickly increasing shoulder activity. Falls or sleeping poorly on the shoulder can trigger it, too.

-**How to fix it?** We focus on rehab exercises FIRST to address the pain and loss of function. Then, muscle therapy and chiropractic adjustments are applied to further decrease pain, increase function, and reduce the muscle issues.

-**How long will it take to heal?** It depends, but most rotator cuff syndrome cases are resolved within 6-12 office visits over 6-10 weeks.
