title: CONDITION OF THE MONTH - PLANTAR FASCIITIS
date: 2024-06-28

We are continuing our monthly series called “Condition of the Month.” Each month, we’ll give a quick bio of an injury we frequently diagnose and treat at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation. These conditions range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities. We wish to educate the public on these injuries, and how we can help as chiropractors.

This month, we are highlighting **plantar fasciitis.**

**-What is it?** On the bottom of the foot is a large ligament called the plantar fascia. When this ligament gets inflamed, irritated, or strained, it can cause pain.

**-What are some symptoms?** There can be a sharp, burning, or aching feeling near the heel on the bottom of the foot. It will especially hurt to put weight on that foot in the morning.

**-What causes it?** This injury happens with increased activity over a short period of time. Poor shoes and flat feet may play a factor, too. Unaddressed calf or hamstring tension can trigger this condition, as well.

**-How to fix it?** We focus on rehab exercises FIRST to address the pain and loss of function. Then, muscle therapy and chiropractic adjustments are applied to further decrease pain, increase function, and reduce the muscle issues.

**-How long will it take to heal?** It depends, but most plantar fasciitis cases are resolved within 4-10 office visits over 4-8 weeks.
