We are continuing our monthly series called “Top Five OR Five Common Physical Medicine Facts.” Each month, we’ll give a top 5 list, ranging from reasons for injuries to conditions themselves to misconceptions about healthcare to ways to help small offices/businesses, and so on. All these problems range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities.

This month, Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation presents **The Top Five Reasons People Go to See a Chiropractor.**

It is estimated that 35 million American adults are treated by a chiropractor annually. That is about 10.3% of the adult population in the US.

But what are the top reasons for seeking out chiropractic care? Well, a study from the National Health Interview Survey has the answer!

Here are the top 5 reasons Americans gave for seeing a chiropractor:

1. Low Back Pain
2. Neck Pain
3. Extremity Joint Pain
4. Headaches
5. General Wellness

**Reach out to us at Rothrock Chiro and Rehab to learn more about each of these reasons for care and how we can help!**
