Winter is here in Happy Valley, and with it comes the inevitable task of shoveling snow. While it may seem like a straightforward chore, improper technique can lead to serious back injuries. Protect your spine and stay pain-free with these top tips from Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation for snow shoveling safety:

1. **Warm Up Before You Start.** Before grabbing your shovel, take a few minutes to stretch and warm up your muscles. Remember, cold, stiff muscles are more prone to injury! Simple stretches for your back, shoulders, and hamstrings can improve flexibility and prepare your body for the task ahead. A brisk walk or some light aerobics can be an extra bonus activity that can also help get your blood flowing. **Don’t know how to properly stretch? Schedule an appointment with us to learn how!**
2. **Use Proper Lifting Techniques.** Shoveling snow is like any other physical activity—it requires proper form and a little practice to do it efficiently and safely. To protect your back, remember to bend your knees, not your waist to let your legs do the heavy lifting. Also, keep the shovel close to your body to minimize strain on your lower back. You’ll also want to avoid twisting, so instead turn your entire body to throw the snow. Last, we recommend you lift small amounts of snow at a time, because overloading your shovel increases the risk of injury.
3. **Choose the Right Shovel.** The right tool can make all the difference. Look for an ergonomic shovel with a curved handle to reduce the need for bending. This will also allow you to drive power with your legs while pushing snow instead of your arms. A lightweight plastic blade can also minimize strain compared to heavier metal options. Consider a smaller blade to avoid lifting overly heavy loads, if you’re tempted to push too much at once.
4. **Take Breaks and Stay Hydrated.** Even though it’s cold, you can dehydrate just as quickly as in the summer heat! The cold air is often very dry, and the layers of jackets and coats make you whip up a deceptive sweat. Moreover, snow shoveling is a workout, so treat it like one! Take regular breaks to rest your muscles and avoid overexertion. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, too.
5. **Schedule a Chiropractic Check-Up with Us!** Frequent snow shoveling can take a toll on your spine and muscles, even with the best technique. Regular chiropractic care at our office can help prevent injuries by ensuring your spine is properly aligned and your body is functioning at its best.
