title: CONDITION OF THE MONTH - SHOULDER IMPINGEMENT
date: 2024-07-03
---

We are continuing our monthly series called “Condition of the Month.” Each month, we’ll give a quick bio of an injury we frequently diagnose and treat at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation. These conditions range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities. We wish to educate the public on these injuries, and how we can help as chiropractors.

This month, we are highlighting **shoulder impingement.**

**-What is it?** The space between the humerus (upper arm bone) and scapula (shoulder blade) narrows, either due to structural or functional changes.

**-What are some symptoms?** There can be a sharp, stabbing, or burning pain on the front of the shoulder. This pain will peak during overhead activities, such as lifting or serving in tennis.

**-What causes it?** This injury can happen with increased activity over a short period of time, or from repetitive overuse. Weak or injured rotator cuff muscles can factor in, too.

**-How to fix it?** We focus on rehab exercises FIRST to address the pain and loss of function. Then, muscle therapy and chiropractic adjustments are applied to further decrease pain, increase function, and reduce the muscle issues.

**-How long will it take to heal?** It depends, but most shoulder impingement cases are resolved within 5-10 office visits over 4-8 weeks.
