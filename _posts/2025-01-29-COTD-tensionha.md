title: CONDITION OF THE MONTH - TENSION HEADACHE
date: 2025-01-29
---

We are continuing our monthly series called “Condition of the Month.” Each month, we’ll give a quick bio of an injury we frequently diagnose and treat at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation. These conditions range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities. We wish to educate the public on these injuries, and how we can help as chiropractors.

This month, we are highlighting **tension headache.**

-**What is it?** The nerves, muscles, and joints of the upper neck get strained and irritated due to stress, tension, and/or injury. All of these structures radiate pain into the head and skull.

-**What are some symptoms?** Classically, patients will report dullness, aching, and/or throbbing into the back of their skull. It can wrap all the way up to the eyebrows, like a ram’s horn pattern.

-**What causes it?** Looking down at phones, looking down at computer screens, long car rides, and poor posture are common causes. Whiplash from a car accident or a sports injury can cause them.

-**How to fix it?** We focus on rehab exercises FIRST to address the pain and loss of function. Then, muscle therapy and chiropractic adjustments are applied to further decrease pain, increase function, and reduce the muscle issues.

-**How long will it take to heal?** It depends, but most tension headache cases are resolved within 5-10 office visits over 5-10 weeks.
