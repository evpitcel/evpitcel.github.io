We are continuing our monthly series called “Top Five OR Five Common Physical Medicine Facts.” Each month, we’ll give a top 5 list, ranging from reasons for injuries to conditions themselves to misconceptions about healthcare to ways to help small offices/businesses, and so on. All these problems range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities.

This month, Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation presents **Five Common Low Back Injuries.**

**First, understand that low back pain is common!**

Did you know that 80% of American adults will experience a serious episode of low back pain at some point in their lives?

This condition is unfortunately very common. In fact, low back pain is the FIFTH most common reason for all physician visits, and it ranks number two for symptomatic reasons to see a doctor (only upper respiratory is above it, according to the NIH). Here are FIVE common injuries in the low back:

1. Lumbar Sprain/Strain
2. Lumbar Disc Herniation
3. Degenerative Disc Disease
4. Sciatica/Pinched Nerve
5. Spondylolisthesis

**Reach out to us at Rothrock Chiro and Rehab to learn more about each of these diagnoses and how we can help!**
