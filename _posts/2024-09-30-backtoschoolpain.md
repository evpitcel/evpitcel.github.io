Hey, Penn State undergrad and grad students! Also shouting out to Penns Valley, Bellefonte, Bald Eagle, and State High students!

We know you’re about a month into your new school year, and we hope everyone is doing well so far. Your ergonomics and posture matter so much for how you physically feel each day at school, so we want to bring an essential factor to your attention: **YOUR BACKPACK!**

Improper use of backpacks is a common cause of back pain and posture problems for students of all ages. Carrying too much weight or wearing a backpack incorrectly can strain the spine, leading to discomfort or even long-term spinal issues. Here are five tips to help you all avoid backpack strain, with insights on how chiropractic care can address potential problems.

1. **Choose the right backpack.** The first step to avoiding backpack strain is selecting a backpack that promotes good posture. Look for these features:

-Wide, padded shoulder straps to evenly distribute weight.

-A padded back for added comfort and support.

-A waist or chest strap to stabilize the load and keep the backpack centered on your body.

A well-designed backpack minimizes the risk of muscle strain and encourages proper alignment of your spine and body.
2. **Keep the load light.** One of the most common causes of backpack-related pain is carrying too much weight. A backpack should weigh **no more than 10-15% of your body weight.** So we encourage you to:

-Pack only the essentials for the day.

-Use lockers or cubbies to store heavy textbooks.

-Clean out the backpack each week to avoid unnecessary clutter.

Overloading a backpack can lead to poor posture, causing you to lean forward or shift to one side. This can strain the neck, shoulders, and back.
3. **Use both shoulder straps.** We see this one done incorrectly ALL the time! Wearing a backpack over one shoulder might seem convenient, but it creates an uneven distribution of weight that can lead to muscle imbalances and spinal misalignments. So you should:

-Always use both shoulder straps, even if you’re in a hurry. You are never in too much of a rush to jeopardize your physical health!

-Adjust the straps so the backpack sits evenly across the back, with the bottom of the bag resting near the lower back.

Using both straps helps prevent twisting and straining of the spine, and that will decrease the chance of injury significantly.
4. **Pack smart by balancing the load.** Packing a backpack properly is just as important as how it’s carried. Heavier items should be placed closest to the back, with lighter items in the front (further away from your body). This helps keep the weight centered and reduces the strain on the spine. We encourage you to:

-Organize your backpacks with heavier books near your back.

-Avoid packing too many small, heavy items in the front pockets.

Balanced packing helps maintain a neutral posture, minimizing the risk of spinal issues.
5. **Check in with a chiropractor.** If you already sustained pain as a result of your backpack, it’s not too late to start feeling better! If you are already experiencing back, neck, or shoulder pain, it’s important to address the issue before it worsens. Our care can help by:

-Identifying the spinal segments that need to be adjusted and rehabbed, as they were caused by improper backpack use.

-Providing home exercises to relieve pressure and restore balance outside of the office.

-Offering personalized advice on posture, ergonomics, and backpack use to prevent future strain and problems.

Regular chiropractic check-ups ensure that your spine is functionally as strong and stable as it can be, reducing the risk of long-term pain and problems.

Avoiding backpack strain is crucial for maintaining a healthy spine during the school year. By following these simple tips, you all can reduce the risk of back pain and posture problems. And if discomfort arises, chiropractic care and home exercise prescription at Rothrock Chiro & Rehab offers an effective way to address and prevent spinal issues, helping you stay healthy and focused throughout the school year.
