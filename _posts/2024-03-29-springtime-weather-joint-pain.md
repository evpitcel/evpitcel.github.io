Spring is finally here for Penn State University and the State College community! As the weather gets warmer and changes, some joint and muscle pains may begin to unmask themselves. Here are 5 great tips to manage these nuisances naturally!

1. **Stay Active with Gentle Exercises.** It’s imperative to maintain regular physical activity, such as walking, swimming, yoga, pilates, HIIT sessions, or gentle stretching exercises. This will keep your joints flexible and reduce stiffness caused by weather changes.
2. **Maintain a Healthy Diet.** We emphasize the importance of a balanced diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains (not highly refined), rich-source proteins, and omega-3 fatty acids found in fish. These foods help reduce joint inflammation and promote your overall joint health.
3. **Stay Hydrated:!** Set reminders on your phone or home devices to keep drinking water throughout the day. It’s critical for you to stay properly hydrated, as dehydration can worsen joint pain and stiffness. Drinking an adequate amount of water each day can help keep joints lubricated and functioning smoothly. The gold standard is your body weight in pounds, divided by two in ounces (ie a 150 pound person should take in 75 ounces of water daily, at least).
4. **Use Heat and Cold Therapy.** Heat packs or warm baths relax your muscles and increase blood flow to sore joints. Alternatively, cold packs or ice packs work to reduce inflammation and numb pain in swollen joints. Use these thermal tools to your advantage!
5. **Consider Chiropractic Care.** You should consider chiropractic adjustments and treatments as part of your natural approach to managing joint pain. Chiropractic care at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation strives to increase joint mobility, reduce pain, and enhance overall musculoskeletal health.
