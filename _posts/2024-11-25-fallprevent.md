It’s late fall and early (dare we say it) winter. Here in Central Pennsylvania and Happy Valley, that means wetter, cooler weather. Moreover, slippery surfaces become more common, increasing the risk of slips and falls. For older adults or anyone with balance issues, these seasonal changes can pose a real hazard. Chiropractic care that’s focused on improving mobility and balance offers a proactive way to help avoid falls and prevent injury. Here are five tips on how chiropractic and rehabilitation care can help you stay safe and steady on your feet this fall. Let’s help you worry less about cold rain, leaves covering the sidewalk, and (dare we say it) snow!

1. **Enhance Balance with Specific Adjustments.** Chiropractic adjustments can improve spinal flexibility, function, and healing from microtrauma, which all directly impact your balance. Misalignments and derangements can disrupt the body’s natural equilibrium, causing instability and increasing the risk of falls. By receiving regular adjustments, especially during fall and early winter, you can enhance your body’s ability to stay balanced and react quickly to slippery surfaces.
2. **Strengthen Core Stability.** A strong core provides stability and support, which is essential for good balance and fall prevention. At Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation, we will prescribe specific exercises to target your core muscles during your strengthening phase of care, helping to build muscle balance that aids stability and reduces strain on your lower back and joints. A strong core can make it easier to react to unexpected movements, reducing the risk of falls on slick or uneven surfaces.
3. **Improve Joint Mobility and Flexibility.** Restricted mobility in the hips, knees, or ankles can interfere with safe walking, making it difficult to acclimate to uneven terrain or slippery areas. Our chiropractic care often includes mobility exercises and can include lower extremity adjustments designed to increase flexibility and joint range of motion. With improved mobility, you’ll find it easier to maintain stability and adapt your gait to avoid falls in slippery conditions.
4. **Reduce Pain and Tension That Affect Balance.** Pain or muscle tension in areas like the lower back, knees, or feet can make walking uncomfortable and less steady. We address these issues through adjustments, soft tissue work, flexion-distraction of the lumbar spine, and rehabilitative exercises. By reducing discomfort, chiropractic care helps you walk with more confidence and stability, minimizing fall risks.
5. **Receive Personalized Balance Training.** We have balance pads, balance boards, and exercise balls in our practice to challenge balancing activities during the strengthening phase of care. We provide balance and proprioceptive training to help patients improve coordination and body awareness. We aim to challenge your body’s ability to maintain stability. With regular practice, these exercises can enhance your reaction time and overall balance, giving you extra confidence when navigating fall’s slippery sidewalks and wet leaves.


**By integrating chiropractic care into your routine,** you can improve your body’s alignment, stability, and mobility, reducing the risk of falls as the weather changes here in Happy Valley. Our rehabilitation exercise plans, including McKenzie corrections, core strengthening, stretching to reduce pain, and balance training, will keep you safe this fall, as well. Stay proactive this season—prioritize your balance and seek chiropractic care at Rothrock to keep yourself safe and steady all through fall.

Don’t dread snow, ice, and wet pavement; prime your body to face it head on this season!
