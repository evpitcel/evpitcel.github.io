**Macros & Micros: The Role of Protein in Your Health**

Protein is more than just a macronutrient—it’s essential for muscle repair, metabolism, immune function, and even inflammation control. Whether you're recovering from an injury, experiencing joint pain, or just trying to maintain optimal health, getting the right amount and type of protein is crucial.

In this edition of Macros & Micros, Dr. Emery Pitcel of Rothrock Chiropractic & Rehabilitation and Dr. Maggie Sopic of ReCenter Chiropractic Wellness & Functional Medicine dive deep into the importance of protein in our diet. We’re breaking down how protein supports your body and how chiropractic care and functional medicine can help ensure your body is making the most of it.

**Why Is Protein So Important?**

Protein is often associated with muscle growth and strength, but its benefits go far beyond that. It plays a key role in:
1. Muscle Integrity & Recovery – Protein helps repair tissues and build strength, making it essential for those recovering from injuries, workouts, or chronic pain conditions.
2. Connective Tissue & Joint Health – Collagen, a major component of cartilage, tendons, and ligaments, is made from amino acids found in protein. Ensuring adequate intake can help prevent joint pain and stiffness.
3. Immune Function – Your immune system depends on proteins to create antibodies and repair tissues, helping you stay healthy and resilient.
4. Inflammation Control – Protein, particularly when balanced with the right nutrients, can help reduce chronic inflammation—a major factor in conditions like arthritis and back pain.
5. Energy & Metabolism – Ever feel that afternoon energy crash? Protein helps regulate blood sugar levels and supports steady energy throughout the day.

**Are You Getting Enough Protein?**

Many people underestimate how much protein they actually need—especially if they are active, recovering from an injury, or dealing with chronic pain. Here are some signs that you might need to increase your protein intake:
1. Fatigue or sluggishness, especially in the afternoon
2. Slow healing from injuries or workouts
3. Joint pain or stiffness
4. Frequent colds or a weakened immune system
5. Difficulty building or maintaining muscle

**How Much Protein Do You Really Need?**

While protein needs vary depending on age, activity level, and health status, a general guideline is:
1. Sedentary individuals: 0.8g of protein per kg of body weight
2. Active individuals & athletes: 1.2-2.0g of protein per kg
3. Injury recovery & chronic pain patients: 1.5-2.5g of protein per kg
For example, a 150-pound (68 kg) person who is active should aim for at least 80-136g of protein per day to support muscle recovery and joint health.

**The Protein Debate: Animal-Based vs. Plant-Based**

Both animal and plant-based proteins can be great sources of essential amino acids, but there are important differences:
1. Animal-Based Proteins (meat, eggs, dairy, fish) provide all essential amino acids and are rich in collagen, which supports joint health.
2. Plant-Based Proteins (beans, lentils, quinoa, tofu) can be great for digestion and anti-inflammatory benefits but may require combining sources to get all essential amino acids.
For vegans and vegetarians, it’s important to mix protein sources and possibly supplement with essential amino acids to prevent deficiencies.

**Is Too Much Protein Bad for You?**

One of the biggest myths about protein is that too much can harm your kidneys. While excessive intake may be a concern for individuals with pre-existing kidney disease, healthy individuals can typically process higher protein diets without issue.

However, balance is key—too much protein without proper hydration and digestion can lead to bloating, digestive discomfort, and nutrient imbalances.

**How Chiropractic & Functional Medicine Support Protein Absorption**

Even if you’re eating enough protein, your body may not be digesting and absorbing it properly. That’s where chiropractic and functional medicine come in:
1. Gut Health Optimization – Functional medicine can help address digestive issues like low stomach acid, leaky gut, and enzyme deficiencies, which can impact protein breakdown.
2. Lifestyle & Nutrition Coaching – We can provide personalized guidance to help you balance macronutrients for better energy, pain relief, and recovery.

**Tips for Increasing Protein Intake Without Digestive Discomfort**

1. Start Slow – Gradually increase protein intake to allow your body to adjust.
2. Prioritize Whole Foods – Lean meats, eggs, fish, beans, and nuts are excellent choices.
3. Hydrate Well – Drinking enough water helps with digestion and absorption.
4. Use Digestive Enzymes – If you experience bloating, consider supplementing with enzymes to support protein breakdown.
5. Spread Protein Throughout the Day – Instead of loading up on protein at dinner, aim for balanced meals throughout the day.

**Final Thoughts**

If you’re struggling with pain, slow recovery, or energy crashes, your protein intake could be the missing piece to feeling your best! Chiropractic care and functional medicine can help optimize digestion, recovery, and overall well-being, so you can get the most out of your nutrition.
