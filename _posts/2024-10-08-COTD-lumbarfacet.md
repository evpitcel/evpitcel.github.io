title: CONDITION OF THE MONTH - LUMBAR FACET SYNDROME
date: 2024-10-08
---

We are continuing our monthly series called “Condition of the Month.” Each month, we’ll give a quick bio of an injury we frequently diagnose and treat at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation. These conditions range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities. We wish to educate the public on these injuries, and how we can help as chiropractors.

This month, we are highlighting **lumbar facet syndrome.**

**-What is it?** In the lumbar spine, there are a set of joints on the back of each joint segment called facets (or Z-joints). If these get inflamed, irritated, or injured, then low back pain results.

**-What are some symptoms?** Patients report a lot of stiffness in the mornings, difficulty with arching backwards or rising from sitting, and walking too long can really be painful.

**-What causes it?** This injury can happen from whiplash in a car accident, a sports trauma injury, too much repetitive extension (ie cheer/gymnasts with back handsprings), or poor posture.

**-How to fix it?** We focus on rehab exercises FIRST to address the pain and loss of function. Then, muscle therapy and chiropractic adjustments are applied to further decrease pain, increase function, and reduce the muscle issues.

**-How long will it take to heal?** It depends, but most lumbar facet syndrome cases are resolved within 6-12 office visits over 6-12 weeks.

**-Think you or someone you know is struggling with this condition? Call (814) 441-5532 to schedule, or schedule online today for help!**
