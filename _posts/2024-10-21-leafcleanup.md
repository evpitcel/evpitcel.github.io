As the vibrant colors of autumn take over Happy Valley, many of us residents of Centre County find ourselves outside, raking leaves and preparing our yards for winter. While leaf-cleaning can be a satisfying task, it often leads to back pain if not done correctly. To keep your spine healthy and pain-free, here are five ergonomic tips and some solid chiropractic advice for avoiding back strain during this busy season. Let’s go!!

1. **Warm Up Before You Start.** Just like any physical activity, yard work can put a strain on your muscles if you jump into it cold. Start with a 5-10 minute warm-up that includes light stretching and walking to increase circulation and loosen your muscles. Focus on your lower back, hamstrings, and shoulders to prepare the muscles you'll be using the most. If you aren’t sure what stretches are best here, then schedule with us so we can build your stretching and exercises plan for home!
2. **Use Proper Raking Technique.** This one is easy for people to neglect as they rush. When raking, it's easy to fall into bad posture habits that strain your lower back. To avoid this, stand upright with your knees slightly bent and keep one foot in front of the other for better balance. Use your arms and legs to do the work, not your back. Try to avoid twisting or reaching too far by raking leaves in small, controlled motions. Remember to switch sides frequently to balance the workload on both sides of your body, reducing strain on your spine. The goal should be to spend at least ⅓ of the time on your non-dominant side, but 50-50% on each side would be most ideal!
3. **Take Breaks and Switch Tasks.** It’s easy to overdo it when trying to get your yard ready for winter, but overexertion is one of the most common causes of back pain during yard work. Slow down a little and take frequent breaks to rest your muscles and prevent fatigue. Aim for a 5-10 minute break every 30-60 minutes to stretch, hydrate, and reset your posture. Alternating between raking, bagging leaves, and other tasks will give your muscles a chance to recover and avoid repetitive strain on your back.
4. **Lift with Your Legs, Not Your Back.** You all knew this one was coming, right?? Whether you're lifting heavy bags of leaves or moving other equipment, always lift using proper form to protect your spine. Squat down with your knees bent and your back straight, and lift by pushing through your legs and glutes while keeping the load close to your body. Avoid bending at the waist or twisting while lifting, as this can lead to serious back injuries like muscle strains or disc herniations. If an object is too heavy, ask for help or use a wheelbarrow to transport it.
5. **Seek Chiropractic Care for Preventive/Proactive Maintenance.** If you're prone to back pain, consider visiting Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation before starting your yard work this season. We can assess your spine, functionality, and muscle tension. Then, we’ll perform adjustments and provide advice on ergonomic techniques to help prevent injuries.

**By following these tips,** you can keep your back healthy and pain-free while you tackle your yard work this leaf-cleaning season. Taking care of your spine will ensure you enjoy the beauty of fall without the discomfort of back pain!
