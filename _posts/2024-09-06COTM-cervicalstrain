title: CONDITION OF THE MONTH - CERVICAL STRAIN
date: 2024-09-06
---

We are continuing our monthly series called “Condition of the Month.” Each month, we’ll give a quick bio of an injury we frequently diagnose and treat at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation. These conditions range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities. We wish to educate the public on these injuries, and how we can help as chiropractors.

This month, we are highlighting **cervical strain.**

**-What is it?** The neck contains more than 20 different muscles. If any muscle is overstretched, compressed, or overused then pain and injury can happen.

**-What are some symptoms?** Patients report difficulty turning their head, or they may get pain working on a computer/phone. Sometimes headaches can set in, too.

**-What causes it?** This injury can happen from whiplash in a car accident. Contact sports can hurt the muscles. Poor posture sustained too long can injure the neck muscles, too.

**-How to fix it?** We focus on rehab exercises FIRST to address the pain and loss of function. Then, muscle therapy and chiropractic adjustments are applied to further decrease pain, increase function, and reduce the muscle issues.

**-How long will it take to heal?** It depends, but most cervical strain cases are resolved within 4-8 office visits over 6-12 weeks.

**Think you or someone you know is struggling with this condition? Call (814) 441-5532 to schedule, or schedule online today for help!**
