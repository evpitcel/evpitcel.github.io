Happy December, Happy Valley!! Which means, the holidays are right around the corner!

The holidays bring joy, celebration, and connection, and we all cherish the time with family, friends, and loved ones. But, the holidays can also be a source of major stress. From hectic schedules to physical strain from decorating or shopping, holiday stress can take a toll on the body. Care at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation offers a natural way to manage stress and keep your body functioning at its best during the festive season. Here are five tips to maintain balance and health during the holidays.

1. **Prioritize Your Posture.** Holiday activities like cooking, decorating, or carrying heavy shopping bags can strain your spine. Poor posture, whether from standing for long hours or slouching at your desk to finish end-of-year tasks, exacerbates physical stress. Regular chiropractic adjustments can alleviate the strain on your spine, relieving tension and promoting better posture. We can also educate you on proper use of ergonomic supports, such as a lumbar cushion, and how to take breaks to stretch if you’re sitting or standing for extended periods.
2. **Combat the Effects of Stress with Chiropractic Care.** When you're stressed, your muscles tighten, your heart rate increases, and your nervous system can become overstimulated. The sympathetic system gets overactivated when we are stressed, leading to more issues like indigestion and shortness of breath. Our chiropractic adjustments can help reduce tension in your muscles, promote better blood flow to the muscles and joints, and restore balance to your nervous system. This leaves you feeling more relaxed and better equipped to handle the season's demands. So, schedule a chiropractic visit to reset your body and reduce the physical effects of stress!
3. **Make Sleep a Priority.** Holiday stress often interferes with sleep, leading to a cycle of exhaustion and irritability. Previous minor injuries can become more problematic, because our bodies don’t heal as well when our sleep quality suffers. This reduced healing can further disrupt sleep patterns by causing more discomfort, and so on. Plus, adults frequently partake in drinking during the holidays, further harming ideal sleep patterns. Chiropractic care improves spinal ailments, helping your body relax and enabling better-quality sleep, at least from the physical pain angle of things. This season, create a calming bedtime routine and avoid screens before bed to ensure restorative rest. Get the best sleep you can this holiday.
4. **Stay Active and Hydrated.** Holiday indulgences and busy schedules can make it hard to stay active, but movement and hydration are essential for managing stress and keeping your body in balance. Gentle exercises, like walking or yoga, can reduce tension and improve mood. Even performing a small fraction of our prescribed rehab exercises can do wonders in keeping you physically and emotionally healthy. Chiropractic care can further support these activities by ensuring your joints are mobile and pain-free. So, we encourage you to simply set aside 15-20 minutes daily for physical activity; it’s worth it! And remember to drink plenty of water, especially if you’re consuming holiday treats and adult beverages.
5. **Practice Mindful Self-Care.** The holidays can be emotionally taxing, and taking time for self-care is crucial. Activities like meditation, journaling, or simply unplugging for an evening can lower stress levels. Combining these practices with an adjustment from our practice will assist in addressing both the mental and physical impacts of holiday stress. Take time to identify your stress triggers and incorporate mindfulness practices to stay calm and centered. Your body will thank you for it!

**Holiday stress doesn’t have to take control of your health.** By incorporating chiropractic care and some rehab exercises into your routine, you can get a big boost towards feeling your best this season. And by following these tips above, you can maintain balance and enjoy a healthier, happier holiday season. If you're feeling overwhelmed or feeling some physical pain, **a visit to Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation might be the perfect gift to yourself this Holiday!**
