title: CONDITION OF THE MONTH - KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS
date: 2025-03-31
---

We are continuing our monthly series called “Condition of the Month.” Each month, we’ll give a quick bio of an injury we frequently diagnose and treat at Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation. These conditions range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities. We wish to educate the public on these injuries, and how we can help as chiropractors.

This month, we are highlighting **knee osteoarthritis.**

-**What is it?** As the cartilage in the knee breaks down over time, the space in the knee joint narrows. This may get to the point of becoming “bone on bone.”

-**What are some symptoms?** There will be pain that gradually worsens with time. Climbing stairs, standing for too long, and walking too long typically worsens symptoms. The knee will be very stiff in the morning, especially.

-**What causes it?** Wear and lack of repair as we age is the number one cause. Previous heavy trauma can accelerate OA, as well.

-**How to fix it?** We focus on rehab exercises FIRST to address the pain and loss of function. Then, muscle therapy and chiropractic adjustments are applied to further decrease pain, increase function, and reduce the muscle issues.

-**How long will it take to heal?** It depends, but OA knee cases that don’t require surgery can be improved within 6-12 office visits over 8-12 weeks.
