We are starting a new monthly series called “Top 5 Physical Medicine Facts.” Each month, we’ll give a top 5 list, ranging from reasons for injuries to conditions themselves to misconceptions about healthcare to ways to help small offices, and so on. All these problems range from common to uncommon in the State College and Centre County communities.

This month, Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation presents **The Top 5 Primary Headaches.**

**What is a primary headache?**

Headache pain can be very debilitating. It impacts one’s focus, which causes loss of work productivity and decreased quality of life.

Primary headaches are caused by overactivity OR problems with pain-sensitive structures of the brain. These headaches are not a warning sign of underlying pathology, though.

**Here are the top 5 primary headaches:**

1. Migraine
2. Migraine with aura
3. Tension Headache
4. Cluster Headache
5. Trigeminal Nerve Referral Pain (Provided by Mayo Clinic Staff)

**Reach out to us at Rothrock Chiro and Rehab to learn more about each of these headaches and how we can help!**
