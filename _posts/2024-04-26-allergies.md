Suffering from seasonal allergies this spring??

Spring is a gorgeous time of year for Penn State University, Happy Valley, Centre County, and Central Pennsylvania. The flowers are popping, the trees are coming back from their dormancy, and the grass is getting greener. BUT, with all of that comes the dreaded SPRING ALLERGIES!

Your body’s response to allergens can create neck pain, low back pain, and headaches. Sinus headaches pop up. The runny nose can trigger coughing and sneezing, which in turn can overload the neck and low back. Sleep quality can drop, thus increasing physical symptoms. The list goes on, sadly.

So, here are some tips to help residents of Happy Valley and Penn State students to reduce their allergy load this spring, and therefore reduce some physical pain symptoms. And we’ll highlight how chiropractic and rehabilitation exercises here at Rothrock Chiro & Rehab can help.

1. **Maintain Indoor Air Quality.** Keep indoor air as pristine as possible by using air purifiers, regularly changing HVAC filters, and keeping windows closed during high pollen seasons. This can reduce exposure to allergens, thus reducing nasal congestion and other associated symptoms that can secondarily trigger neck and low back pain.
2. **Stay Hydrated.** Drink plenty of water to help flush out toxins, support your immune system, and remove allergens from your system. As a bonus, proper hydration supports spinal health by keeping intervertebral discs hydrated and maintaining joint flexibility. There’s almost zero downside to proper hydration!
3. **Manage Allergy Symptoms.** Use over-the-counter or prescription allergy medications as advised by your physician. These will help to manage symptoms like sneezing, congestion, and inflammation. Controlling allergies can indirectly alleviate back pain by reducing inflammation, coughing, and sneezing. Our musculoskeletal system responds to perceived internal health issues, after all (viscero-somatic responses).
4. **Practice Good Posture.** Be mindful of your posture always, but especially during allergy flare-ups when you may experience more discomfort. Maintain a straight spine, avoid slouching, and use ergonomic furniture and equipment to support proper spinal alignment. At Rothrock Chiropractic and Rehabilitation, we focus on prescribing exercises and providing postural correction techniques to help you improve this area directly!
5. **Seek Chiropractic Care.** Consult with a chiropractor for personalized treatment plans that address both your allergy-related symptoms and neck, low back, and headache pains. Chiropractic adjustments can help improve spinal function, which will relieve pressure on nerves, reduce local inflammation, and promote overall wellness. This makes chiropractic an effective option for managing your back pain exacerbation by seasonal allergies.

Spring is a beautiful time of year. But with the beauty comes allergy symptoms. Focus on improving your air quality, hydrating your body, managing symptoms with OTC medications (as the bottle recommends, please!), and using good posture.
