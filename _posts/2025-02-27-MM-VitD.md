**The Power of Vitamin D: Why Your Health Depends on It**

Vitamin D is often called the “sunshine vitamin” because our bodies produce it when exposed to sunlight. However, especially during the winter months, many people become deficient, which can impact overall health in significant ways. At Rothrock Chiropractic & Rehabilitation and ReCenter Chiropractic Wellness & Functional Medicine, we recognize the essential role vitamin D plays in bone health, immune function, mood regulation, and more.

**Why Vitamin D Matters**

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, including:
-Bone Health – Helps regulate calcium and phosphorus levels, preventing conditions like osteoporosis and rickets.
-Immune Function – Supports the body's ability to fight infections and may play a role in reducing inflammation.
-Mood & Mental Health – Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to seasonal depression, fatigue, and mood instability.
-Nerve & Muscle Function – Helps with neuromuscular coordination and reduces the risk of muscle pain and weakness.
-Cardiovascular & Autoimmune Support – May help regulate blood pressure and support individuals with autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto’s and fibromyalgia.

**Are You Deficient? Watch for These Signs**

Since vitamin D plays such a broad role in overall health, a deficiency can lead to wide-ranging symptoms, including:
-Fatigue and low energy
-Muscle pain, cramps, or weakness
-Frequent illnesses or infections
-Joint discomfort or bone pain
-Mood changes or depression
-Slow healing wounds

If you experience any of these symptoms, it may be time to get your vitamin D levels tested.

**The Role of Vitamin D in Musculoskeletal Health**

Vitamin D plays a crucial role in bone strength, muscle function, and even nerve signaling. When levels are low, patients may experience:
-Bone and joint pain – Because vitamin D helps regulate calcium absorption, deficiencies can contribute to bone weakening and conditions like osteoporosis.
-Muscle weakness and tension – Patients with chronic neck, back, or general muscle soreness may actually be experiencing vitamin D deficiency rather than a traditional musculoskeletal issue.
-Increased fall risk in older adults – Low vitamin D can lead to muscle weakness and coordination problems, increasing the likelihood of falls and fractures.

For our patients experiencing lingering pain or slow recovery despite chiropractic adjustments and rehab, we consider vitamin D levels as a potential factor. If necessary, we’ll guide you in seeking appropriate functional medicine support or medical consultation.

**Vitamin D and Immune Function: A Whole-Body Approach**

Beyond its role in musculoskeletal health, vitamin D is essential for immune function. Research shows a strong correlation between vitamin D deficiency and various health conditions, including:
-Autoimmune disorders, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
-Increased susceptibility to infections
-Conditions like POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), which has gained attention due to its link with long COVID

While vitamin D deficiency isn’t necessarily the cause of these conditions, maintaining adequate levels can be a game-changer in supporting overall wellness.

**How Much Vitamin D Do You Need?**

The recommended daily intake varies, but general guidelines suggest:
-600-800 IU per day for adolescents and adults
-400 IU per day for infants (often provided as a liquid drop for breastfed babies)

Since vitamin D is fat-soluble, excessive intake can lead to toxicity, potentially causing kidney stones or other health concerns. That’s why we always recommend working with a healthcare provider to determine safe and effective supplementation.

**The Chiropractic Approach: A Holistic View on Health**

At our practices, we follow a four-to-six-visit rule when assessing patient progress. If musculoskeletal issues aren’t responding as expected within that time frame, we dig deeper—considering underlying issues such as vitamin deficiencies, inflammation, or metabolic imbalances. If necessary, we’ll collaborate with functional medicine specialists or refer you to the appropriate healthcare provider to ensure you get the best care possible.

**How to Maintain Healthy Vitamin D Levels**

During winter months, vitamin D deficiency is more common due to limited sun exposure. Here’s how to maintain optimal levels:
-Get Safe Sun Exposure – Aim for 10-30 minutes of direct sunlight (without sunscreen) a few times per week.
-Eat Vitamin D-Rich Foods – Include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), egg yolks, fortified dairy products, and mushrooms.
-Consider Supplementation – Many people require high-quality vitamin D3 supplements, especially during winter. Take them with a meal containing healthy fats for best absorption.
-Test Your Levels – Functional medicine practitioners, such as Dr. Maggie Sopic, can provide a blood test to determine if supplementation is needed.

**Supplementation: Choosing the Right Vitamin D**

If you struggle to get enough vitamin D from sunlight and food alone, supplementation may be necessary—especially if testing shows a deficiency.
-Vitamin D3 with K2 – A great option for improving absorption and ensuring calcium is properly utilized in the body.
-Drops vs. Capsules – Liquid drops allow for easier dose adjustments, while capsules are a convenient option.
-Dosage Considerations – Some people may require higher doses initially (a loading phase) before transitioning to a maintenance dose.

However, supplementation should be based on testing rather than guesswork.

**Testing Your Vitamin D Levels**

If you're experiencing persistent fatigue, joint pain, or muscle weakness, it may be time to check your vitamin D levels. The most common test is the 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH D) blood test.
-Optimal Vitamin D Levels: Most functional medicine providers aim for 60-70 ng/mL for optimal health, though traditional medical guidelines often consider 30 ng/mL as "normal." However, research suggests that staying closer to 60-70 ng/mL may provide greater benefits for energy levels, immune function, and overall well-being.

**Barriers to Vitamin D Absorption**

Even with proper supplementation, some individuals struggle to raise their vitamin D levels due to underlying health conditions, such as:
-Gut Dysfunction – Conditions like Crohn’s disease, IBS, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can impair absorption.
-Liver or Gallbladder Issues – Since vitamin D is fat-soluble, bile production is necessary for proper absorption.
-Medications – Steroids, statins, diuretics, and laxatives can interfere with vitamin D metabolism.
If you’re supplementing and not seeing improvements, it’s essential to work with a healthcare provider to identify potential underlying issues.

**How Chiropractic & Functional Medicine Can Help**

At Rothrock Chiropractic & Rehabilitation and ReCenter Chiropractic Wellness & Functional Medicine, we take a holistic approach to health. If you’re experiencing pain, fatigue, or immune challenges, we assess whether vitamin D deficiency could be a contributing factor.
-Dr. Emery Pitcel focuses on neuromuscular health and rehabilitation exercises to ensure optimal nerve function.
-Dr. Maggie Sopic integrates functional medicine to address underlying deficiencies and improve whole-body wellness.
