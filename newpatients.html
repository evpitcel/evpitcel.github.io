	<!-- <h2>New Patient Special</h2> -->
    <p>The first visit is about 60 minutes long and includes not only a consultation and physical exam, but also prescription of home exercises and treatment. Effectively, it's two appointments covered in one visit.
		
	<h2>Billing & Insurance</h2>
    <p>We accept most insurance. The level of coverage will depend on your specific plan, your deductible, and whether or not we are considered an in-network provider on your particular plan. We are happy to run an insurance verification as soon as you provide your plan details--usually before or during your first visit. Below is a list of some of the major insurance carriers for which we can run electronic verification and billing:
	<br>  - Aetna 
	<br>  - Blue Cross Blue Shield (Highmark/Capital)
	<br>  - Cigna 
	<br>  - Geisinger
	<br>  - Medicare 
	<br>  - United Healthcare
	<br>  - UPMC
	</p>
	<p>Chiropractice care is considered a qualified medical expense under most HSA plans.

<h3>What to Expect</h3>	
	<p>Each new patient will undergo an initial exam including a medical history and physical assessment. Dr. Emery will use this to develop a treatment plan for your specific case. He will start you on that treatment plan in your first visit. </p>
