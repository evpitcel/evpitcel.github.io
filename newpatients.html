	<!-- <h2>New Patient Special</h2> -->
<h3>Our Practice's Approach</h3>	
    <p>The first visit is about 60 minutes long and includes not only a consultation and physical exam, but also prescription of home exercises and treatment. Effectively, it's two appointments covered in one visit.

    <p>We firmly believe that the best outcomes are obtained by focusing on three clinical pillars: chiropractic adjustments, muscle therapies (trigger point release, PNF stretching, pin-and-stretch technique, etc), and rehabilitation exercises. We emphasize the importance of team work and self-empowerment for improving your overall health. We will perform the adjustments and muscle techniques in office to enhance your healing, while you'll work on home rehab exercises to continue making progress outside of the practice.

    <p>During the first visit, Dr. Emery will most likely perform a <a href="https://mckenzieinstitute.org/patients/" style="color:black">McKenzie Method (MDT) assessment</a>. This specific form of physical therapy will establish if your injured area has a directional preference, which is the most effective and efficient movement direction to reduce pain, decrease muscle tension, and improve functionality. The vast majority of musculoskeletal injuries demonstrate a directional preference. Dr. Emery will try to establish that on visit one, although it can take 1-5 visits to properly classify a case.
	    
	<h2>Billing & Insurance</h2>
    <p>We accept most insurance. The level of coverage will depend on your specific plan, your deductible, and whether or not we are considered an in-network provider on your particular plan. We are happy to run an insurance verification as soon as you provide your plan details--usually before or during your first visit. Below is a list of some of the major insurance carriers for which we can run electronic verification and billing:
	<br>  - Aetna 
	<br>  - Blue Cross Blue Shield (Highmark/Capital)
	<br>  - Cigna 
	<br>  - Geisinger
	<br>  - Medicare 
	<br>  - United Healthcare
	<br>  - UPMC
	</p>
	<p>Chiropractice care is considered a qualified medical expense under most HSA plans.

<h3>What to Expect</h3>	
	<p>Each new patient will undergo an initial exam including a medical history and physical assessment. Exercise prescription and treatments are performed on this first visit as well, unless red flags determine otherwise. Dr. Emery will use the diagnosis gained from the new patient visit to develop a treatment plan for your specific case. He will completely lay out the treatment plan and expectations during the second office visit.</p>
